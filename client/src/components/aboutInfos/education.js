        <p>
          In my pursuit of knowledge, I graduated with a Bachelor of Applied
          Information in mid November 2023. My bachelor gave me a wide range of
          knowledge in the various areas such as .NET MAUI development, MERN Web
          development, game development through Unity and Unreal using C# and a
          little C++, and some other experiences. These skills combined with my
          personal ventures in the development world like working with python,
          wordpress software, and some other software it gives me wide selection of
          adaptable skills. Which can help me to learn any required skills I
          need to complete the task a hand.
