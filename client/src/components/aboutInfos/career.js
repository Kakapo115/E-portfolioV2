        <p>
          My journey mainly reflects physical labor experience, but ive always
          wanted to work in the tech industry as I found a love for the logical
          way things work. So I hope to bring the soft skills I gathered in my
          years of physical labour work into the digital world. All this leading
          me to be ready to jump into any work in the industry putting the
          skills I learned in school and the personal learning ive done into
          practice.
