        <p>
          I'm a passionate individual with a Bachelor of Applied Information
          graduated at the end of 2023. My place I call home is in Tauranga in
          the mighty Bay Of Plenty. My free time is spent either in the digital
          realm or in nature camping, fishing, and the like. This gives me a
          good look at how things work which is how I found digital technology,
          which is the place id like to work and having finished my degree im
          ready to get into it.
